# Week 2

Goal: Get comfortable with the basics of linear models (perceptrons)

**Core**

- [x] `Watch` [Learning from data, lecture 4 - Error and noise](https://work.caltech.edu/lectures.html)
- [x] `Watch` [Learning from data, lecture 5 - Training vs testing](https://work.caltech.edu/lectures.html)

**Supplementary material**

- [ ] `Read` Chapter 2 from [Perceptrons: An introduction to computational geometry](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/perceptrons)

**Field reading**

- [x] `Book` Chapter 2 from [Complexity, a guided tour](https://www.amazon.se/Complexity-Guided-Tour-Melanie-Mitchell/dp/0199798109/)
- [ ] `Paper` [Learning machine learning with personal data helps stakeholders ground advocacy arguments in model mechanics](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/papers/Register2020PersonalData.pdf)


**Do**

- [x] Learning from data, homework 2
- [x] Chapter 5 (Statistics) from Data Science from Scratch 


**Notes**

I got stuck on the Linear Regression exercises in homework 2 for Learning from Data so I decided to take a step back and work at a lower level (working through DS from scratch).
