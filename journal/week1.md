# Basics of learning - linear models

This week, my goal is to understand the fundamentals of neural networks - the linear model, and to try to write my own version of a perceptron learning algorithm.


**Learn**

- [x] `Watch` Learning from data, lecture on linear models
- [x] `Watch` [But what is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)
- [ ] `Read` [Neural networks and deep learning, chapter 1](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)
- [ ] `Review` https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch
- [ ] `Review` https://github.com/cedrickchee/neural-network-in-13-lines
- [ ] `Review` https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/

**Supplementary material**

- [x] `Read` [Wikipedia entry on Perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)
- [ ] `Read` [Wikipedia entry on activation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function)
- [ ] `Read` Chapter 1 from [Perceptrons: An introduction to computational geometry](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/perceptrons)

**Do**

- [ ] Learning from data, homework 1
- [ ] Write my own perceptron 

**Field reading**

- [x] Chapter 1 from [Complexity, a guided tour](https://www.amazon.se/Complexity-Guided-Tour-Melanie-Mitchell/dp/0199798109/)
