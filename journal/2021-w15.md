# Basics of learning - linear models

This week, my goal is to understand the fundamentals of neural networks - the linear model, and to try to write my own version of a perceptron learning algorithm.


**Learn**

- [x] Learning from data, lecture on linear models
- [x] 3blue1brown video on perceptrons
- [ ] [Neural networks and deep learning, chapter 1](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)

**Read**

- [ ] [Wikipedia entry on Perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)
- [ ] [Wikipedia entry on activation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function)
