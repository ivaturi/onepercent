#  1 - where I am today

Okay, so today isn't _literally_ the first day I've started down this path. I've started and stopped a few times in the last few years. I'm starting this blog as an attempt to force myself to stick to it this time.

So far, I've been through these videos:

  - [But what is a neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w)
  - [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w)
  - [What is backpropagation really doing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U)

I'm partway through [Learning from data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html), and I've read through these books:

- [AIQ: How people and machines are smarter together](https://www.amazon.com/AIQ-People-Machines-Smarter-Together/dp/1250182158), by Nick Polson and James Scott
- [Dark data: why what you don't know matters](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691182377/dark-data), by David Hand
- [Architecting data lakes](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/architecting-data-lakes/9781492033004/), by Ben Sharma and Alica Laplante
